			<h1>Las Vegas</h1>
			<p>[November 12, 2021] When we arrived at the Las Vegas airport we were very tired and took a Lyft to our hotel and enjoyed a delicious pizza for dinner. After dinner we went up to our room and slept</p>
			<p>[November 13, 2021] For breakfast we went to the Bagelmania and tried their donuts. After that we had brunch at the Bellagio and shopped around a little bit. After we left the Bellagio we visted the Coke, M&M, and Hershey Stores and bought some candy at them.</p>

			<h1>Thanksgiving Cruise</h1>
			<p>[November 20, 2021] When we woke up in our hotel in Fort Lauderdale, we were ready as ever to board our cruise, the <i>Odyssey of the Seas!</i> There were also quite the amount of cruise ships waiting to board.</p>
			<p>[November 21, 2021] After we woke up we watched us dock in Nassau headed to the Windjammer for some breakfast and I enjoyed some buffet bacon. Their bacon in the Windjammer is AMAZING! If you ever go on a Royal Carribean cruise, definetley check out the Windjammer. After breakfast we went to our reservation for the North Star, and it was pretty awesome to see Nassau from all the way up there. We then went and chilled by the pool in the infinity spa. It was a cool experience viewing the normal pool from another floor. Once we were done and dryed off we headed to the room so I could prepare for iFly. After we were dressed and I was ready we went to the back of the ship to do some indoor skydiving at the iFly. After I flew in the wind tunnel, which was thrilling, we went over to the Windjammer for lunch. We didn't have any plans until Giovanni's Italian Kitchen at dinner so we just chilled in the room until then. Eventually while we were in the room, we sailed away from Nassau and I took some beautiful pictures.</p>
			<p>[November 22, 2021] We didn't have many plans for a while after we woke up so we decided to go get some breakfast at the Windjammer and then headed to the pool to relax and get some sun. After a few hours outside we were hungry, so as usual went to the Windjammer for lunch. We went  to the suite lounge and because it's in the back of the ship we can see the wake of the boat.</p>
